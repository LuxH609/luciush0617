                        <h1>Architectural TPMS Structures: A Sustainable Modular Prototype for Energy-Efficient Future
                            Data Centers</h1>
                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
                        <p><i>In the digital age, the rising global demand for data centers underscores the urgent need for more
                            efficient cooling systems. Although air cooling remains the most prevalent method in current
                            data centers, it is hindered by high energy consumption and limited efficiency. To tackle these
                            challenges, I propose a modular data center architecture prototype based on Triply Periodic
                            Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures. By leveraging the exceptional heat exchange properties and
                            structural advantages of TPMS, this design aims to significantly enhance cooling efficiency and
                            reduce operational energy costs. In addition to its cooling benefits, this research explores the use
                            of sustainable materials, such as bio-concrete and mycelium, combined with advanced digital
                            prefabrication techniques, enabling efficient transportation and rapid on-site assembly, while
                            lowering carbon emissions during construction. The proposed prototype addresses the increasing
                            global demand for scalable, energy-efficient data center solutions. Furthermore, the research
                            encourages the reuse of waste heat, promoting energy recycling and reducing environmental
                            impact, all in alignment with global sustainability goals.</i></p>

                        <P><strong>RESEARCH BACKGROUND</strong></P>
                        <p><i>
                            Fueled by the rapid advancement of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI),
                            big data, and cloud computing, data centers—centralized facilities for storing, managing, and
                            processing vast amounts of data—have emerged as essential infrastructure in recent years
                            <span class="citation">(Dayarathna et al., 2016)</span>. Recent data from Synergy Research Group reveals that the number of
                            large-scale data centers operated by hyperscale providers surpassed 1,000 in early 2024,
                            doubling since 2017. Additionally, projections suggest that the total capacity of these data
                            centers will double again within the next four years.

                        <p><i>
                            With the rapid expansion of data centers, managing the substantial heat generated by servers
                            under high computational loads has become a critical challenge <span class="citation">(Habibi Khalaj &amp; Halgamuge,
                            2017)</span>. Thus, Efficient cooling systems are essential for stable operation of data centers.
                            According to Uptime Institute&#39;s 2021 survey, cooling systems typically consume around 30% of
                            a data center&#39;s total energy consumption, as reflected in the global average PUE of 1.57 in the
                            report <span class="citation">(2021 Data Center Industry Survey Results, n.d.) </span>. Basically, there are three primary
                            methods commonly used for cooling: air cooling, liquid cooling, and free cooling <span class="citation">(Zhang et al., 2021) </span>.
                        </i></p>
                        <p><i>
                            Air cooling, the most widely adopted approach, relies on air conditioning systems. Yet, it is
                            limited by the low heat capacity of air, thus consuming a huge amount of power. As one of the
                            alternatives, liquid cooling, which uses liquids to improve heat dissipation and energy efficiency
                            with relatively lower energy usage, delivers better performance than air cooling. However, it is
                            hindered by higher installation and maintenance costs and significantly higher potential for
                            leakage rick <span class="citation">(Zhang et al., 2021)</span>.
                        </i></p>
                        <p><i>
                            Considering the huge potential of energy saving, free cooling, which leverages natural sources
                            such as cold air or water from the environment, offers significantly lower energy consumption.
                            Intel research indicates that free cooling, combined with higher operating temperatures, can
                            reduce cooling costs by up to 67%, potentially saving $2.87 million annually for a 10 MW data
                            center. However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on geographical location and weather
                            conditions <span class="citation">(Lee &amp; Chen, 2013)</span>, as demonstrated by Google&#39;s use of seawater for cooling in
                            Finland and cold air in Ireland. Besides, it also faces challenges including increasing the IT
                            equipment aging and damage due to air humidity and contamination <span class="citation">(Sorell, 2007)</span>, which will
                            increase the cost for sub-systems like dehumidification and filtration, as well as maintaining and
                            cleaning cost for IT systems. Furthermore, it also requires a backup system using other cooling
                            methods. Table 1 provides a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the three methods
                            mentioned above as applied to existing data centers.
